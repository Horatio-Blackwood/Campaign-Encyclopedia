# Campaign-Encyclopedia
Campaign Encyclopedia is a tool designed to help world builders.  It was designed with pen and paper table top games like Dungeons and Dragons, Pathfinder, FATE, Gamma World or even your own home-brew system in mind.

## Relationshps
The purpose of Campaign Encyclopedia is to help game masters keep track of story elements and their relationships to one another.  It accomplishes this by allowing them to specify these relationships between PCs, NPC, key historical events, important items or artifacts, places and organizations.  Once defined, these relationships become links that help you navigate your campaign, not unlike a wiki - but in Campaign Encyclopedia the links themselves have an intrinsic meaning.  If the relationships provided with the application don't suit your world - they are redifineable from within the application.

## Public and Secret Data
The details of your NPCs, PCs, places, legendary artifacts and secret organizations are organized into public description, relationships and tags and secret description, relationships and tags, allowing you as a game master to keep your public and secret knowledge straight.  If you'd like you can also create things that are entirely secret.  All of your data is searchable by name, type and tag.  Campaign Encyclopedia enables you to record a timeline for your world that shows key events throughout history as well as define your calendar as you've imagined it for your game world.


## Export
Once written your campaign can be exported to both PDF and the native campaign file format (JSON) with or without any secret data.  This allows your players to use your world information as a reference.
